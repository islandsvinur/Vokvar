Flow visualization
==================

Debian GNU/Linux
----------------

To install the required libraries in Debian, run the following command:

  # aptitude install fftw3-dev freeglut3-dev

To build it:

  $ ln -s Makefile.linux Makefile
  $ make

To run it:

  $ ./fluids

Mac OS X
--------

To run Fluids, just double click the Fluids application icon.

To build Fluids, you'll need the FFTW libraries. Install FFTW first, for
instance from Fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net/, the package is called fftw).

  $ ln -s Makefile.macosx Makefile
  $ make Fluids.app

Now open the Fluids application.

Note: It might be necessary to edit the Makefile according to the exact
location of the FFTW library. Also remember that you need to have the Developer
Tools installed.


Have fun!
