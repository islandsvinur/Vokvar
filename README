Flow visualization
==================

This program is written in the beautiful Ruby programming language[1].

Software requirements:
  - FFTW3 (redistributed with Debian)
  - Ruby (> 1.8) (redistributed with Debian)
  - libopengl-ruby (> 0.32f) (redistributed with Debian)
  - NArray (0.5.8 redistributed with this package)
  - Ruby-FFTW3 (0.2 redistributed with this package)

To install the first three packages, run the following command:

  # aptitude install fftw3 fftw3-dev ruby ruby-dev libopengl-ruby

After this, unpack the two files narray-0.5.8.tar.gz and ruby-fftw3-0.2.tar.gz
and for each resulting directory (first narray, only then ruby-fftw!), run:

  $ ruby extconf.rb
  $ make
  # make install

You should now be able to run fluids.rb:

  $ ruby fluids.rb


Have fun!
