% Conclusion

A working software tool was implemented, with streamlines and isolines. It was
tested to compile and run properly on both Debian~GNU/Linux and Mac~OS~X.

The initial source code needed some cleanup first, when it was clear how it
worked, the design process started and resulted in the separate modules as they
are now. The example code wasn't very clean and extensible, so this caused some
head breakage at first. Especially because of unfamiliarity with OpenGL and
FFTW.

\subsection{Limitations}

Some ideas that have come up during development, but which were dismissed
because of scope or time concerns.

Two visualizations cannot both have a different palettes at the same time. This
would be perfectly possible to implement, but usually one only uses one
visualization at a time, so this won't be a big issue.

Free placement of streamlines would have been cool, would however also create
the need for an interface to the OpenGL drag handler to react on mouse events.
